
In order to run GAST you need:

1) An installation of Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/)

2) Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
   (GAST has been developed with version 2.0; but 1.9 should work, too)
   Rubygems needed (install by running 'gem install ...'):
     sinatra
     haml
     ruby-graphviz
     htmlentities
     unicode_utils
   Or install with bundler (if necessary, run 'gem install bundler' before):
     1. navigate to the GAST main directory
     2. run 'bundle install'

3) Browser (GAST has been developed with Firefox, other browsers might work or not)



Using the program:

1) start 'main.rb' in GAST main directory ('ruby main.rb')

2) navigate to the following address in your browser: 'http://localhost:4567/'
