GAST has been developed by Lennart Bierkandt in the DGF-financed project "Towards a corpus-based typology of clause linkage" (http://linktype.iaa.uni-jena.de/) at Friedrich-Schiller-Universit√§t Jena.

The initial version of GAST was conceived by Volker Gast, Christoph Rzymski and Lennart Bierkandt, and implemented by Christoph Rzymski.
